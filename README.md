# Automated Data Extraction & Web Form Filling (Python & JavaScript)
This project demonstrates a hybrid automation workflow that extracts structured training data from Excel using Python, then automatically fills a multi-row training form in a web page using JavaScript DOM automation.

The example uses mock HTML and dummy data, and does not interact with any third-party or government system.

🚀 Features
---
✔ Excel Data Extraction (Python)

- Reads a structured list of trainings from a sheet

- Extracts only the relevant rows (e.g., row 18 to 36)

- Handles irregular table formatting

- Normalizes dates into browser-friendly formats

- Produces a clean JSON output ready for autofill

✔ Web Form Autofill (JavaScript)

- Dynamically adds rows to the training form

- Fills text inputs, date inputs, number fields, and dropdowns

- Dispatches DOM events so the form behaves as if filled manually

- Works on any HTML form with the expected field names

✔ Browser Workflow

- Python generates JSON from Excel

- JSON is passed into the browser console (or injected via Selenium)

- JavaScript fills the web form automatically

🧩 How It Works (Conceptual)
---

1. Python reads the Excel sheet and converts the training rows into a JSON list.

2. Open the mock training form in the browser.

3. Paste the JavaScript autofill script into the browser console, passing the JSON data.

4. The script automatically:

- Adds the required number of rows

- Fills each training entry

- Selects dropdowns correctly

- Triggers real DOM events

This simulates how automation can assist with repetitive form-filling tasks.

📎 Author Notes
---
This automation project was originally created to explore:

- Extracting complex data from structured Excel files

- Automating multi-row browser forms

- Integrating Python and JavaScript in a real workflow

It evolved into a clean, reusable automation framework suitable for learning and portfolio demonstration.

- 🧑‍💻 Python Script: ConvertExcelJSON.py (safe version)

This version extracts a sample training dataset and prints JSON.

(It uses row indices instead of headers to simulate original workflow.)

- 🌐 JavaScript Script: autofill_training_form.js (safe version)

This version fills a mock HTML table (not tied to any real website).

- 🧪 Mock HTML Form: mock_training_form.html

A safe generic version of the training table automated.
